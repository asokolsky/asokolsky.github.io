title: NAS4Free 9

Install of NAS4Free 9.0.0.1.43 on to a flash stuck in PATA was uneventful.
But unlike Solaris, OpenIndiana and FreeNAS the web GUI showed me exactly what
I wanted to know - real time status of NAS appliance: CPU frequency and load,
SMART status of hard drives.

Power management worked and CPU frequency was adjusting according to load!
On Solaris and OpenIndiana `smartctl` never worked for me. On FreeNAS
`smartctl` did work but `powerd` did not and GUI was lacking this info.

I imported a ZFS hard drive created on FreeNAS8 and jumped to the network
throughput testing. Writing to NAS (I copied a 5.08GB DVD from win7 PC) went at
around 40MB/sec.

Reading from NAS begins but then fails. Windows shows "Network Error" dialog
`There is a problem accessing \\nas\zfs`.
`dmesg` tells me "pid 7239 (smbd), uid 0: exited on signal 6"
log.nmbd and log.smbd contain nothing but startup messages.

I will try to re-create ZFS vdev and pool and reproduce.

More from the GUI diagnostics log:
