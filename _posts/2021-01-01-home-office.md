After few iterations I arrived at a set-up which works well for me.

## Desk

I wanted something affordable with adjustable height.  This
[Husky Workbench](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-46-in-W-x-24-in-D-Steel-Adjustable-Height-Solid-Wood-Top-Workbench-Table-in-Black-HOLT46XDB12/301809931#overlay)
does the job for me.  Solid wood top is 48" x 24".  You have to crank
it to raise it from 29" to 42".  This is fun - it makes weird noises.

## Chair

Aeron is awesome but bulky.  I found
[Setu](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/side-chairs/setu-chair/)
does the same at a fraction of the price.  It is discontinued but
widely available on a second-hand market for around $200 in the SF Bay Area.

## Monitor

Tried few.  Ended up with a 38" UltraWide QHD+ curved display,
[LG 38WN75C-B](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087YZG5YS).
Lovely!

## Soundbar

You gotta hear it, right?  This is a decent
[soundbar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HKMC9ZP).

## Headset

If you also need to talk, you'd better use headset. I am pretty happy with
[Jabra Evolve 65 Wireless](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ODRSN0A/)


## Thunderbolt Hub

I use [Amazon Basics hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086H3FMPZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title).
It does the job.  Realtek 8153 USB-to-Ethernet chip stopped working though.
I wish it were 2.5 Gbps Ethernet but it is not.
