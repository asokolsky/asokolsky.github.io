## Updates


Since [the last summary](/2021/01/01/home-office.html) I went mostly in the
direction of the simplification:

* [business audio setup](/hardware/business-audio.html) replaced by a single
bt headset - Jabra Evolve 65.
* [business video setup](/hardware/business-video.html) distilled to a
[MOKOSE 4K USB Webcam](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FHBRKSK), sometimes
augmented with a led lighting strip.
* [Amazon Basics hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086H3FMPZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title)
proved to be a poor choice - first Ethernet controller burned.  Next a spike
caused by the nearby AC being turned on caused video controller to stop working.
I now have two Dell hubs - at least these have their firmware updated regularly.
The new monitors should support thunderbolt/usb4/usb3 directly.

Here is an
