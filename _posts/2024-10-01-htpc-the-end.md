title: The End of HTPC Era

I have been using HTPCs for about 20 years now.  The promis of a "bit-perfect"
audio made the decision to repurpose a Window PC for home theater a no-brainer.
It even worked for a while.  I used Windows, then
[Media Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Center) with its
[Remote](https://www.google.com/search?q=microsoft+windows+media+remote),
then varios flavors of Linux.  Most of the time with a standard desktop
GUI.  For media player I used [mpc-hc](https://mpc-hc.org/) and then
[vlc](https://www.videolan.org/).  MPC was a pretty amaizing example of using
Windows Media filters and COM programming, RIP.

I do not think I ever succeeded in making my Linux HTPC output Dolby Atmos
to my Samsung TV and soundbar.

I stopped recommending HTPC after I verfied that VLC works on AppleTV AND
can connect to the NAS over SMB.  And you can't beat the conveninece of
casting to an AppleTV.

Alas, last week I retired [my last HTPC](/hardware/exi/) and rebuilt it as a
workstation.

Our media consumption patterns do change.  Today I spend more time listening to
youtube on my iPhone than anything else.
