# Consul

## What is Consul?

In an environment with different microservices; Consul solves the problem of
service discovery by maintaining a service registry, configuration problem by
providing a key value store and the problem of access segmentation amongst
services by centrally managing a service graph. It provides a service mesh for
all the different services running in our systems.
