## What is the Difference Between RUN and CMD?

RUN: Executes commands during the image build process, creating a new layer. Typically used for installing software packages.

```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```

CMD: Specifies the default command to run when the container starts. It executes at runtime, not during the build process.

```
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

## How to Use Multi-Stage Builds in Dockerfiles?

Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile to create temporary stages that help keep the final image smaller.

```
# Build stage
FROM golang:1.17 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

# Production stage
FROM alpine:latest
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp
CMD ["/myapp"]
```

## What is the Purpose of the EXPOSE Instruction?

EXPOSE: Documents the ports on which the container listens at runtime. It does not publish the ports but serves as a hint for users running the container.

To make the ports accessible, use the -p flag with docker run.

```
EXPOSE 8080
```

## What is the Difference Between ARG and ENV?

ARG: Defines a variable that users can pass at build time using docker build --build-arg. It is not available at runtime.

```
ARG VERSION=1.0
RUN echo $VERSION
ENV NODE_ENV=production
```

ENV: Sets environment variables that are available both during build time and at runtime.

```
ENV NODE_ENV=production
```

## How Do You Optimize Docker Images for Size?

1. Use multi-stage builds to separate build dependencies from runtime dependencies.

```
# Build stage
FROM node:14 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

# Production stage
FROM node:14-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app .
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

2. Combine commands in RUN statements to reduce the number of layers.

```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl git
```

3. Use smaller base images, like Alpine, to minimize the image size.

## How Can You Persist Data Across Container Restarts?

Use Docker volumes or bind mounts to persist data outside of the containerâ€™s filesystem. This ensures data remains available even when the container is restarted or recreated.

```
docker run -v mydata:/data myapp
```

## What is the Purpose of the LABEL Instruction?

LABEL: Adds metadata to the image, such as maintainer information, version, or description. This helps with the documentation and management of images.

```
LABEL maintainer="you@example.com" version="1.0" description="A sample app"
```

## Why Might You Use HEALTHCHECK in a Dockerfile?

HEALTHCHECK: Defines a command to test whether the container is functioning correctly. If the health check fails, Docker can automatically restart the container or take other corrective actions.

```
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
```

## How Can You Handle Secrets in Dockerfiles?

Avoid hardcoding secrets in Dockerfiles. Instead, use Docker secrets, environment variables, or external tools like HashiCorp Vault to manage sensitive information securely.

```
ENV API_KEY=${API_KEY}
```

## What is the Difference Between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?

CMD: Provides defaults for an executing container. It can be overridden by passing arguments to docker run.

```
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

ENTRYPOINT: Configures a container to run as an executable. Commands and arguments provided with docker run are appended to the ENTRYPOINT instruction.

```
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx"]
CMD ["-g", "daemon off;"]
```
