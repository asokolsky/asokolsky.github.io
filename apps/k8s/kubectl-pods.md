# k8s Pods

You specify a toleration for a pod in the PodSpec. Both of the following
tolerations "match" the taint created by the kubectl taint line above, and thus
a pod with either toleration would be able to schedule onto node1:

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```
