# Self-hosted AWS

Would it not be nice to host AWS on your (home) LAN?

## S3

[minio](https://min.io/) is S3-compatible and is
[available on TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/services/s3/).
It works with AWS
[cli client](https://docs.min.io/docs/aws-cli-with-minio.html),
[python client](https://docs.min.io/docs/how-to-use-aws-sdk-for-python-with-minio-server.html).

## DynamoDB
