## 80m HF band (3.500-4.000 MHz)

ITU Region|Band
----------|----
1|3.5 – 3.8 MHz
2|3.5 – 4.0 MHz
3|3.5 – 3.9 MHz

Upper part of the 80m Band in ITU Region 2 countries, is commonly named as 75m band.

The [80-meter band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80-meter_band) is considered the most reliable all-season long-distance (DX) band. It is popular for DX contacts at night and reliable for medium-distance contacts during the day. In the US and Canada, a portion of this band allows for single-sideband voice and AM voice transmissions.

This band is good for local communications during the day, and hardly ever good for communications over intercontinental distances during daylight hours. During late afternoon and night , when noise decreases, it can be effective even for worldwide communications.

Bands below 10 MHz use lower sideband (LSB).

The band is also popular for Amateur Satellite Service.
