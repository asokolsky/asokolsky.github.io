## Terms

* an electronic _keyer_ can be used while operating CW to assist in the manual sending of Morse code.
* use the transceivers' keypad or variable frequency oscillator (VFO) knob to adjust the desired operating frequency.
* a typical 50-watt output mobile FM transceiver requires a power supply rating of 13.8V at 12A.
* Standing Wave Ration (SWR) ideally should be 1:1. An SWR 4:1 indicates impedance mismatch.

## Digital Modes

* Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) is a data transmission system that uses error detection and retransmission to ensure reliable data delivery.
* Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) is used to share messages, status, position, and queries over short distances.
* an amateur radio station that connects other amateur stations to the internet is called a gateway.
* A digipeater is used to connect one station to another via RF.
* a digital mode hot spot allows hams using digital radios such as DMR or D-STAR to communicate on digital voice or data systems via the internet while at home (or mobile).
* a station operating using the [FT8 digital mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FT8) should have the transceiverâ€™s audio output and input connected to the audio input and output of a computer running WSJT-X software.
* a DMR code plug is a software file that contains the settings and parameters needed to program a Digital Mobile Radio (DMR).
* IRLP (Internet Radio Linking Project) nodes are accessed by using DTMF (dual-tone multi-frequency) tones.
* Echolink is an option that repeater managers can add to their equipment that allows for a signal to be received from over the internet and transmitted over the air, as well as for that internet station to monitor the rest of the conversation. Echolink requires a smart phone or computer application and a login.
* a Digital Mobile Radio (DMR) code plug contains all the programming information needed to operate a DMR device, including details like frequencies, talk groups, color codes, system IDs, tones, and other settings required to access specific repeaters and communicate on designated channels within a network; essentially acting as a configuration file for the radio itself.
* A digital voice transceiver is a device that converts microphone audio into digital bits and sends them out over radio waves. Digital transceivers can send and receive more types of data than analog ones, including encrypted communication and video. Digital transmissions are also often clearer and more detailed than analog transmissions.

## Antennas

The Yagi antenna is a directional antenna and offers the greatest gain.

Antenna loading is a technique that electrically lengthens an antenna without physically increasing its size.

## Connectors and Cables

* [PL-259-type connectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHF_connector) are commonly used at HF and VHF frequencies.
* a [Type N connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_connector) is most suitable for frequencies above 400 MHz.
* [RG58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RG-58) has a single tinned copper braid shield.
* RG223 features two layers of a silver-coated copper shield. The double shielding on RG223 makes it a [larger and heavier cable than RG58](https://awcwire.wordpress.com/2016/04/20/rg223-vs-rg58-product-knockout/).
* RG213 cables offer lower attenuation and higher power handling capabilities compared to RG58, making them suitable for long-distance transmissions and high-power applications.

## Safety

50 MHz has the lowest value for maximum permissible exposure limit. The FCC has determined that the human body can easily absorb frequencies between 30 MHz and 300 MHz. This range requires the lowest exposure. The closest amateur band within this range is the 6-meter band, or 50 MHz.


* if the antenna falls, no part of it can come closer than 10 feet to the power wires.
* the antenna could contact high-voltage power lines.
* Local electrical codes establish the proper grounding techniques for amateur radio towers and antennas. A lightning arrester should be installed in a coaxial feed line mounted on a grounded panel near where feed lines enter the building.
* For all external ground rods or earth connections, you must consider a high current situation from a lightning strike. Therefore, you should bond them together with heavy wire or conductive strap that can handle high current.
* When installing grounding conductors used for lightning protection, sharp bends must be avoided. Remember that lightning takes a straight path to ground, so you want your ground to be straight and direct.
