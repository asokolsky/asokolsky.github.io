# Business Audio Setup

I use [Zoom PodTrack P4](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F8HL7T7) as an extension of my work-from-home setup,
which allows me to:

* use Rode NTG1 mic for both computer and regular telephone communication
* record phone calls made/taken on my iPhone
* record calls made on my laptop
* conference phone calls and laptop calls.

Setup details:

- input1: not used, muted
- input2: Rode NTG1 via XLR cable, phantom power on, level at 5
- input3: switch to phone, level at 7 - iPhone connected via 
[lightning to headphone jack adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXJFMGF)
and
[TRRS male to male](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RB17ZY1) cable
- input3: switch to USB, level at 5
- wired earphones plugged into output2 - can be any really
- [2xUSB cables](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089DM4KDW) - one to laptop, another to a power supply.
- laptop sound output and input are set to "Zoom P4 Audio"

Amazingly this is all plug and play!  Minor CONS:

- a fixed sampling rate of 44kHz can not be justified
- filters are limited to Low Cut and Limiter.  The latter is nice and I use it.  Compressor is missing and is badly missed.
- no 1/4-20 mounting, seriously?  As a workaround I use "Omoton Adjustable Tablet Stand"
- why two USB cables?  Surely P4 can be powered from a laptop!
- sound pad and mute LEDs are too bright and are distracting, would be nice to control/disable brightness.
- NO indication of input overload!
- LED display is from 20th century, as a workaround I used OBS to set the levels.
