Video setup for Zoom calls.

## Lighting

[Lantern Diffuser](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088FFHK6T)
on [Godox S2 Speedlite Bracket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YFF7B78)
with a simple 60W CFL bulb inside.

## Option 1: Mokose Webcam

[MOKOSE 4K USB Webcam with Manual Focus Lens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FHBRKSK)
has

* good quality video - pretty sharp!
* manual focus is perfectly acceptable

Wide angle - hence distortions, no camera settings ap to customize settings.

## Option 2: Logitech Brio

[Logitech Brio 4K Webcam](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5UOYC4) has:

* nice image quality
* selectable hardware zoom

Unfortunately G Hub software you need to control the camera settings is broken
on Mac OS.

## Option 3: Panasonic Lumix GH5

[GH5](gh5.html) with [14mm F2.5 lens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HV936AY)
connected via USB3.  This is clearly an overkill.
Power drain.
