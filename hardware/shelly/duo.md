From the manual:

* Install the Shelly to the light socket. Press the switch/button
to which Shelly is connected. The Shelly should turn on.
* Press the switch/button again and Shelly will turn off.
* The bulb should create its own Wi-Fi network with SSID like
ShellyBulbDuo-35FA58 for the white model or shellycolorbulb-35FA58 for the
colored version.
* In case the bulb creates no WiFi AP, reset the Device.
* To reset the device: If the Device
has been powered on, you have to power it off and on again 5
consecutive times. Upon each OFF state, please wait 2-3 seconds
8 When the light starts to flash Shelly should return to AP Mode.
* For Shelly duo RGBW â€“ light will start to flash in red, next time you
switched of and on it will light in blue - this mean that the bulb is in AP
more.

## Allocate a Static DHCP Lease

In your router settings ensure that the DHCP lease is static.
