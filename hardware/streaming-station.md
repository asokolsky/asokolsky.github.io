# AV Streaming and Recording Station

## Goals

Primary: a dedicated, low friction AV streaming and recording space for one
person (talking head) with [OBS Studio](/apps/obs/) at its core.

Secondary: video conferencing space.

Constraints: living room with no acoustic treatment.

Non-goals: gaming.

## Streaming/Recording Computer

Reused [Dell Optiplex 7060 micro](dell/optiplex7060micro.html):

* multiple monitor outputs
* multiple USB ports
* powerful enough CPU
* low noise, low power consumption

An attempt to use [Thinkpad P52](lenovo/thinkpad-p52.html) failed because of
the lack of connectivity options for USB and monitors - Thunderbolt3 ports
there do not work.

Decided on two small monitors with a camera between them.  One monitor to record
the desktop, another for setting things up and running [OBS](/apps/obs/).

## Desk and Mounts

Reused
[IKEA LILLÃ…SEN desk](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/lillasen-desk-bamboo-90278277/).
The desk is only 40" x 19".  All equipment is mounted on a couple of
[monitor stands](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B58W3FDL/) and monitor arms
to free the desk space.

## Audio

The audio chain includes:

* [Rode PodMic](https://www.amazon.com/Rode-PODMIC-Dynamic-Podcasting-Microphone/dp/B07MSCRCVK/)
on [Elgato Wave Mic Arm LP](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B097376LKF/) via
XLR cable to
* [Zoom PodTrack P4](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F8HL7T7) via USB cable to the
PC

## Video

The video chain includes
[Sony a7iv](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Camera/dp/B09JZT6YK5/)
with
[Sony FE 20mm f/1.8 G](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-Frame-Large-Aperture-Ultra-Wide-Angle/dp/B08556WW56/)  via
[right angle USB cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BSN51LLN/) to the
streaming/recording PC.

[Elgato Cam Link 4K](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Cam-Link-Broadcast-Camcorder/dp/B07K3FN5MR/)
seems  like an obvious possible improvement.

## Lights

[IKEA Mittled 24" LED strip](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/mittled-led-kitchen-cntrtp-lighting-strip-dimmable-white-00455420/)
bounced off the wall.
