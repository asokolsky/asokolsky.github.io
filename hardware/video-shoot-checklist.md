# Video Shoot Checklist

## Training

Familiarize yourself with the equipment.  Ideally you should be able to
operate it in the dark under the time pressure.

### Audio

[Sony PCM-M10](sony-pcm-m10.md).  Tasks to accomplish:

* power on/off
* check battery level
* replace batteries
* wipe (re-format, not delete!) storage clean
* start the recording and positively verify it is happening
* check audio levels - adjustment not necessary
* play back recording
* mounting the recorder on a rig

### Video

[Panasonic GH5](panasonic-gh5.md).
Tasks to accomplish:

* power on/off
* check battery level
* replace batteries
* wipe (re-format, not delete!) the storage clean
* start the recording and positively verify it is happening
* play back recording
* set the recording mode
* set the overall exposure by changing ISO, exposure time (NOT! for all intents
and purposes  it is fixed for video) and aperture. Avoid blow outs by using
[zebra](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/00077788).
* Manually set the focus.
Use [focus peaking](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/what-is-focus-peaking).
* set [white balance](https://www.exposureguide.com/white-balance/) or just
stick to tungsten.
* Mounting camera on and using video tripod.

## Pre-production

Days if not weeks in advance:

* charge ALL the batteries;
* inspect the site and identify the locations for audio and video recorders;

### Audio

Audio recorder location should be:

* NOT on the emergency evacuation route;
* as close to the source as possible yet not intrusive.
* far enough from the audience to eliminate distracting noises/chatter

What worked for me in the past:

* few meters in front of the stage on a short stand
* suspended few meters above/in front of the stage

Deliverables:

* location(s) for audio recorder(s)

### Video

Video camera location should be:

* NOT on the emergency evacuation route;
* stable - bleachers, because of their instability may not cut it.

What worked for me in the past:

* reserve two seats in the top row, right in front of the stage.

Multiple cameras/locations, from must-haves to nice-to-have:

* general view.  Here the entire stage is captured.  This station may NOT be
manned. Use a 4K camera with the best dynamic range on manual settings.  Prime
lense is ok.  Depth of field should extend from the edge to the very far end of
the stage.  All manual settings.
* actor view.  This manned station captures the action - one, two, three actors
at most.  Premium
[parfocal](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/a-guide-to-parfocal-lenses)
zoom lense on a 4K camera recommended. All manual settings.

Deliverables:

* location(s) for video camera(s);
* lenses to provide the adequate framing for the general and detailed views.

## Production

### Audio

It is unrealistic to expect that a dedicated audio engineer is available.
Hence the rest assumes a fully autonomous recording.

Before the event: set up the recorder on a stand, power it up, wipe storage
clean, set the stand with the recorder aside.  Just few seconds before the
beginning, place the stand in a designated location in front of the stage.
Warn the audience about not stepping on it for their own safety.

During the intermission: move the stand with the recorder aside, verify the
recording is on, stop it.  Check the batteries, replace if needed.

After the event concludes: move the stand with the recorder aside, verify the
recording is on, stop it.  Power off the recorder.

Deliverables:

* raw recordings (one per act) on the storage medium.

### Video

Before the event: set the tripod and the camera up in the designated location.
Install the lense if not there yet.  Power the camera up, check the batteries,
wipe the storage.

Set the overall exposure (and white balance):

* ask for the max lights;
* have talent standing in the front of the stage.  Pick the talent
dressed in the lightest outfit, e.g. white shirt or dress.
* adjust the overall level of the exposure to avoid blow outs.
* you may also adjust white balance if desired.  Sticking to tungsten works.

Ideally the overall exposure will be left intact for the duration of the entire
event unless you see the blow out zebras.  In that case reduce the aperture
(increase F-stop).

Set the focus on the front of the stage.  Set depth of the focus to the entire
stage.

During the event: do NOT look at the stage.  Look at the camera screen.  Make
adjustments as needed.

During the intermission:

* verify the recording is on, stop it.
* check the batteries, replace if needed.

Deliverables:

* raw recordings (one per act) on the storage media.

## Post-production

### Audio

* use the dynamic compression

### Video

* use your video editing skills

Deliverables:

* produced video
