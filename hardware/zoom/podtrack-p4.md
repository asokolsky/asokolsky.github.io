# Zoom PodTrack P4

I use [Zoom PodTrack P4](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F8HL7T7) as a hub for my
work-from-home setup.

[PROS](../business-audio.html)

CONS:

* a fixed sampling rate of 44kHz can not be justified.
* filters are limited to Low Cut and Limiter.  The latter is nice and I use it.
Compressor is missing and is badly missed.
* no 1/4-20 mounting.  As a workaround I use
[Omoton Adjustable Tablet Stand](https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Upgraded-Greater-Stability-OMOTON/dp/B08LYSTZV9/).
* why two USB cables?  Surely P4 can be powered from a laptop!
* sound pad and mute LEDs are too bright and are distracting, would be nice to
control/disable brightness.
* NO indication of input overload!
* LCD display is from the 20th century. As a workaround I used OBS to set the
levels up.
* earphone amps are REALLY noisy.
