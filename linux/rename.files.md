# Bulk File Rename

[Good summary](https://ostechnix.com/how-to-rename-multiple-files-at-once-in-linux/).

What worked for me:

* install mmv using `sudo apt install mmv`;
* [mmv man page](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-mmv/) has good
examples;
* use it

Problematic: `mmv -h` does not work
