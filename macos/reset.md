# MacOS Reset

## NVRAM Reset

A macOS NVRAM (non-volatile random-access memory) reset clears specific system settings—such as volume, screen resolution, and startup disk selection—stored by Intel-based Macs to troubleshoot performance, audio, or booting issues. It is a safe, non-destructive procedure, often referred to as a PRAM reset, that restores default settings without deleting user files.

Note: For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs, a simple restart replaces the need for a manual NVRAM reset.

* shut down your Mac
* turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option,
Command, P, and R.
* release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear
to restart.

## SMC Reset

A macOS System Management Controller (SMC) reset restores default settings for power management, fixing hardware issues like loud fans, battery failure to charge, unexpected shutdowns, or unresponsive power buttons on Intel-based Macs. It is a safe, non-destructive troubleshooting step.

Note: Macs with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) do not have a separate SMC and instead reset by restarting.
