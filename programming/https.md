Python code to establish HTTS connection with a server,
which relies on a custom CA:

```
ses = requests.Session()
ses.verify = '/path/to/CAs'
r = ses.get( 'https://server', verify=False )
```

## HTTPS Client with a Certificate to HTTPS Server

Need to associate a client certificate AND a private key
with a session:

```
ses = requests.Session()
ses.verify = '/path/to/CAs'
ses.cert = '/path/client.cert'
r = ses.get( 'https://server', verify=False )
```
