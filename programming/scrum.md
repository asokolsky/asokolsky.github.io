Here are some scrum Q&A.

## Scrum Master

Explain at least three ways the scrum master could support the product owner.

* Ensure that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the
scrum team as clearly as possible
* Finding techniques for effective product backlog management
* Helping the scrum team understand the need for clear and concise product
backlog items
* Understanding product planning in an empirical environment
* Ensure the product owner knows how to arrange the product backlog to maximize
value
* Understanding and practicing agility
* Facilitating scrum events as requested or needed

List at least three rights of the scrum master

* Ensure that the scrum events take place
* Ensure that each scrum event does not exceed its time box
* Ensure that non-team members do not disrupt the daily scrum
* Participate as a peer team member in the retrospective
* Encourage the scrum team to improve
* Experiment with new ideas
* Have access to stakeholders and decision makers
* Address issues openly

List at least two responsibilities of the scrum master, not directly associated
with a scrum event.

* Not telling the developers how to turn product backlog items into increments
of potentially releasable functionality
* Helping everyone understand scrum theory, practices, rules, and values
* Providing servant leadership to the team and organization
* Helping those outside the scrum team understand which of their interactions
with the scrum team are helpful and which are not
* Helping everyone change their interactions to maximize the value created by
the scrum team
* Using retrospective activities, liberating structures, or analysis techniques
to assist the scrum team with impediments

Describe at least three responsibilities for the scrum master during sprint
planning.

* Facilitate as requested or needed
* Ensure that the event takes place
* Ensure that participants understand the purpose of sprint planning
* Teach the scrum team to keep it within the time-box

Describe at least three responsibilities for the scrum master during daily scrum.

* Facilitating as requested or needed
* Ensure that the event takes place
* Ensure that participants understand the purpose of the daily scrum
* Teach the scrum team to keep it within the time-box
* Ensure that non-team members do not disrupt the daily scrum

Describe at least three responsibilities for the scrum master during sprint
review.

* Facilitating as requested or needed
* Ensure that the event takes place
* Ensure that participants understand the purpose of sprint review
* Teach everyone how to keep it within the time-box

Describe at least three responsibilities for the scrum master during the
retrospective.

* Facilitating as requested or needed
* Ensure that the event takes place
* Ensure that participants understand the purpose of the sprint retrospective
* Teach everyone how to keep it within the time-box
* Ensure that the meeting is positive and productive
* Participate as a peer team member in the meeting


## Product Owner

Discuss at least two reasons why the product owner is a single person and not a
group or a committee.

* Having one person with the authority to set priorities for the team leads to
greater focus and clarity than having that authority be distributed. When
multiple stakeholders can ask the team to do work, the amount of work in
progress tends to go up, and efficiency tends to go down.
* With only one product owner, it is clear who the stakeholders should take
their requests to. This eliminates confusion for the stakeholders. It also
makes it clear who has ultimate responsibility for the ROI of the product.

List at least three rights of the product owner.

* Add, remove, and order items in the product backlog
* Delegate backlog refinement work, while remaining accountable for it
* Only the product owner may direct the team as to what items to work on.
* Have their product decisions respected by everyone in the organization

List at least two responsibilities of the product owner, not directly associated
with a scrum event.

* Clearly expressing product backlog items
* Ordering the items in the product backlog to best achieve goals and missions
* Optimizing the value derived from the work of the developers
* Ensure the product backlog is visible and clear to all, and shows what the
scrum team will most likely work on next
* Ensure the developers understand items in the product backlog

Describe at least three responsibilities for the product owner during sprint
planning.

* Explain and discuss the desired objective for the sprint
* Identify and clarify the product backlog items that would achieve the sprint
goal
* Collaborate with the developers to establish the sprint goal
* Collaborate with the developers to create the forecast of product backlog
items to be completed in the sprint
* Make trade-offs based on feedback from the developers

Describe at least three responsibilities for the product owner during daily
scrum.

* Support the developers’ self-management, avoid directing the day’s work plan
* Do not disrupt the developers as they hold the daily scrum
* Answer questions and offer clarification as needed
* Support the team in overcoming impediments

Describe at least three responsibilities for the product owner during sprint
review.

* Invite stakeholders to the sprint review
* Identify and explain if the sprint goal was met, or not
* Explain which product backlog items have met the definition of done and which
have not
* Discuss the product backlog as it stands
* Project likely delivery dates based on progress so far
* Review how the marketplace or potential use of the product may have changed
and what appears to be the most valuable thing to do next
* Review the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the
next anticipated releases of the product
* Discuss progress toward the product goal

Describe at least three responsibilities for the product owner during the
retrospective.

* Participate in the inspection of how the last sprint went with regards to
people, relationships, process, tools, and the definition of done
* Participate in identifying the most helpful changes to improve the scrum
team’s effectiveness
* Participate in the creation of a plan for implementing improvements to the
way the scrum team does its work

## Developers

List at least five characteristics of the developers (from the 2017 Scrum Guide).

* They are self-organizing. No one, not even the scrum master, tells the
developers how to turn product backlog items  into increments of potentially
releasable functionality.
* Developers are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to
create a product increment.
* Scrum recognizes no other titles for developers, regardless of the work being
performed by the person.
* Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the developers, regardless of domains that
need to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations, or business
analysis.
* Individual developers may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but
accountability belongs to the developers as a whole.

List at least three rights of the developers

* Produce quality work
* Provide their own estimates
* Sign up for work rather than be assigned work
* Organize and manage their own work

List at least two responsibilities of the developers, not directly associated
with a scrum event.

* Instilling quality by adhering to a definition of done
* Holding each other accountable as professionals
* Produce a valuable (usable) product increment which meets the definition of
done, each and every sprint
* Continuously improve their development practices
* Create estimates (product backlog refinement activities are not considered an
event in the scrum framework)
* Assist the product owner in maintaining and refining the product backlog

Describe at least three responsibilities for the developers during sprint
planning.

* Determine the number of items selected from the product backlog for the sprint
* Forecast the functionality that will be developed during the sprint
* Collaborate with the product owner to create the sprint goal
* Select items from the product backlog to include in the current sprint
* Decide how they will build a product increment during the sprint that meets
the sprint goal and the definition of done
* Design the system and the work needed to create the product increment
* Be able to explain to the product owner and scrum master how they intend to
work as a self-managing team to accomplish the sprint goal and create the
anticipated increment

* Answer questions about the product increment
* Discuss progress toward the product goal

* Participate in identifying the most helpful changes to improve the scrum
team’s effectiveness
* Participate in the creation of a plan for implementing improvements to the way
the scrum team does its work


## Final Jeopardy

Discuss how and why the product owner maintains authority over the product while
working collaboratively with the developers and stakeholders.

### How:

The product owner collaborates with the rest of the scrum team and the
stakeholder community to gather ideas and input about what the product should
be and what to build next. Still, only the product owner may add, remove, edit,
or reorder items in the product backlog. Only the product owner may ask the team
to do work.

### Why:

This reduces interruptions and distractions for the developers. By providing
clear focus, the product owner enables the developers to develop more value,
more rapidly.

Describe three scenarios where the scrum master acts as a leader for the scrum
team.

* The scrum master provides leadership by teaching the team the purpose of each
scrum event and helping them accomplish each within the specified time box.
* The scrum master works with leadership to implement the scrum framework in a
way that supports the team in self-organization.
* The scrum master offers the service of facilitation to help the team, and the
greater organization, identify and achieve their goals more effectively.
* Teaching, coaching and mentoring the organization and team in adopting and
using scrum.
* Shielding the team from disturbance.
* Encouraging, supporting and enabling the team to grow and improve.

Discuss why scrum does not have a project manager and what happens to
traditional project management activities.

The duties of a project manager gets split between the product owner, scrum
master, and developers. The product owner makes sure the business is kept up to
date about the product, the schedule, and the budget. Along with the developers,
they make decisions that manage risk. The scrum master is the process expert,
facilitator, and chief impediment remover. The developers make estimates, decide
how much work will be brought in to the sprint, and decide who will do the work,
and when, during the sprint.
